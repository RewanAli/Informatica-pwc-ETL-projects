## 📌 Objective

This ETL project demonstrates how to use the **Normalizer transformation** in **Informatica PowerCenter** to convert wide-format subject scores into a long-format structure suitable for analysis and reporting.
To unpivot student score data from a single row per student into multiple rows — one for each subject — and load it into an Oracle table named `UNPIVOT`.

## 🧾 Source Details

- **Source Type**: Oracle Table
- **Source Table Fields**:
  - `StudentID`
  - `S_Name` (Student Name)
  - `Math`
  - `Science`
  - `English`

Each student has one row with individual subject scores stored in separate columns.

## 🔄 ETL Workflow

### 1. **Source Definition**
- The data is imported from an **Oracle source table** containing student names and their scores in three subjects.

### 2. **Normalizer Transformation**
- The `Normalizer` is used to **convert columns into rows**.
- Repeats the score fields (`Math`, `Science`, `English`) using **occurrence=3**.
- The transformation produces:
  - `GK_SCORE` → Generated key to identify each score instance.
  - `S_Name` → Student name passed through.
  - `Subject_Score` → Holds the actual score.
  - `GCIDScore` → Generated column ID used to identify the subject.

### 3. **Target Definition**
- Data is loaded into an **Oracle target table** named `UNPIVOT`, with the following structure:
  - `S_ID` → Mapped from `GK_SCORE`
  - `S_Name` → Student name
  - `Subject_Score` → The unpivoted score value
  - `Subject_Code` → Mapped from `GCIDScore` to identify the subject

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Informatica PowerCenter**
- **Oracle Database**
- **Normalizer Transformation**

## 🧪 Key Concepts Practiced

- Use of **Normalizer** to unpivot structured data
- Repeating groups in source rows
- Mapping normalized output to structured target
- Loading long-format data into Oracle

## 🖼️ Example Output

| S_ID | S_Name   | Subject_Score | Subject_Code |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 1    | John Doe | 85             | 1 (Math)      |
| 1    | John Doe | 92             | 2 (Science)   |
| 1    | John Doe | 78             | 3 (English)   |

> Note: `Subject_Code` (GCIDScore) can later be mapped to subject names using a reference table or a decoding logic.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Decode `Subject_Code` to show actual subject names (`Math`, `Science`, `English`)
- Add `Load_Date` column for audit tracking
- Apply filters for active/inactive students if needed
