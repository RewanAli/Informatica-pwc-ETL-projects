*Objective
To segment employees based on department and salary, and identify high-earning individuals in non-priority departments using multiple routing and data flow techniques in Informatica.

*Project Workflow
-Source:
Flat file containing employee records with fields: ID, FirstName, LastName, Dept_ID, Salary.

-Source Qualifier Transformation:
Reads from the flat file and filters out any rows with NULL Dept_ID or Salary.

-Router #1 – Salary-Based Segmentation:
Routes remaining records based on:
Salary > 5500
Default group: Others

-Router #2 – Department-Based Segmentation:
Routes data into separate groups:
Dept_ID = 10
Dept_ID = 20
Dept_ID = 30
Default group: All other departments

-Union Transformation:
Combines the default output from Router #1 (non-priority departments) with the default group from Router #2 (non-high earners).
Creates a merged output for "Other Employees".

-Targets:
Separate relational tables for departments 10, 20, and 30.
One consolidated table for "Other Employees" (those not in target departments and not high earners).
