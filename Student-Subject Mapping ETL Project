# üéì Student-Subject Mapping ETL Project (Informatica PowerCenter)

This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using **Informatica PowerCenter**, where data is sourced from two oracle tables, joined, and loaded into an Oracle database table.

## üìå Objective

To create a mapping that merges student and subject data using a join key (SubjectID), then loads the enriched data into a structured target table in Oracle.

## üìÅ Source Files

1. **Subjects File** (`Source 1 - oracle File`)
   - `SubjectID`
   - `SubjectName`

2. **Student-Subject File** (`Source 2 - oracle File`)
   - StudentID
   - S_ID`

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Read Data from oracle Files**  
   - Imported two oracle file sources containing subject and student-subject relationship data.

2. **Sorter Transformation**  
   - Applied on both sources to **improve performance** before joining.  
   - Sorted on `SubjectID`.

3. **Joiner Transformation**  
   - Join Condition: `SubjectID` (Primary Key in Subject file, Foreign Key in Student-Subject file)  
   - Join Type: Inner Join for one time the other master hoin

4. **Target Table (Oracle)**  
   - The final output is loaded into an Oracle table containing:
     - `StudentID`
     - `SubjectID`
     - `SubjectName`

‚ùó Issue Faced During Load
Problem:
The session failed because the Oracle target table did not allow NULL values in the foreign key column (SubjectID). Some incoming records contained NULL in this field, which caused a 
constraint violation and prevented the data from loading.

Resolution:
To fix this:
The target table structure was modified to allow NULL values in the SubjectID column.
The session was re-executed successfully after the change.

‚úÖ Final Outcome
Records were successfully joined and loaded into the Oracle target table.
The session completed without errors and was verified through Workflow Monitor.
The process demonstrated an optimized and reliable data flow using sorting, joining, and RDBMS loading techniques.



## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Informatica PowerCenter**
- **Oracle Database**

## üß™ Key Concepts Practiced

- oracle File Import
- Sorter Transformation
- Joiner Transformation (PK/FK logic)
- Target Load to RDBMS
- Performance optimization through pre-sort

## üìà Output Sample

| StudentID | SubjectID | SubjectName   |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 1001      | MTH101    | Mathematics    |
| 1002      | PHY102    | Physics        |

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- Add `StudentName` by joining with a third student master file  
- Apply filters to exclude inactive students
