## 📌 Objective

This ETL project demonstrates how to extract employee data from a flat file, apply transformations including filtering, sorting, and aggregation, and load the summarized result into an Oracle database table.
To calculate the **total salary** of employees in **Department 10** and store the result in an Oracle table.

## 📁 Source Details

- **Source Type**: Flat File
- **Source Fields**:
  - `EmployeeID`
  - `FName` (First Name)
  - `LName` (Last Name)
  - `Salary`
  - `Dept_ID`

## 🔄 ETL Workflow

### 1. **Filter Transformation**
- Applied a filter to select only records where:
  ```sql
  Dept_ID = '10'

2. Sorter Transformation
Sorted the filtered records by Salary in ascending order to ensure clean and optimized aggregation.

3. Aggregator Transformation
Grouped by Dept_ID
Aggregated function:
SUM(Salary) → Calculates the total salary for Department 10

4. Target Load
Target Type: Oracle Table
Fields Loaded:
Dept_ID
Sum_Salary (total salary of dept 10 employees)

🧪 Key Concepts Practiced
Reading structured data from flat files
Conditional filtering using Filter transformation
Data ordering using Sorter transformation
Aggregation with group-by logic in Aggregator
Oracle target integration

🖼️ Output Example
Dept_ID	Sum_Salary
10	155000

🛠️ Tools Used
Informatica PowerCenter
Flat File as Source
Oracle Database as Target

🧯 Potential Enhancements
Add columns like LoadDate or RecordCount for auditing
Parameterize the department number for reusability
Add exception handling for records with null or invalid salaries
